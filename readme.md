# Invocatio

**Invocatio** is a simple text-based management game written in **MicroPython** for the **CARDPUTER** device, running under the [MicroHydra](https://github.com/echo-lalia/MicroHydra) environment.

The game is inspired by the classic [Hamurabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamurabi_(video_game)) game (also known as *The Sumer Game* or *King of Sumeria*) from the 8-bit era.  
Instead of ruling a kingdom, the player takes on the role of a **leader of a dark cult**.

## About the Game

In Invocatio, the player:
- manages resources,
- perform sacrifices and rituals,
- seeks the favor of ancient, unknowable gods.

The game features a **text-only interface**, turn-based decisions, and a dark atmosphere inspired by the works of **H. P. Lovecraft**.  
Its design deliberately echoes the simplicity and feel of classic management game written in BASIC.

## Installation

1. Make sure **MicroHydra** is installed on your CARDPUTER.
2. Copy the `Invocatio` directory together with all its contents into the `/apps`directory on the device’s internal storage or on an SD card.

## Controls

- The game is entirely text-based.
- Decisions are made by entering numeric values or selecting options as prompted on screen.
- All necessary instructions are displayed during gameplay.
